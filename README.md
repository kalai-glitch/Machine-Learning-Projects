Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

Project Overview:
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes using Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.


Objectives:
Analyze medical data related to heart disease
Build a prediction model using Logistic Regression
Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics
Predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease


🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm
Logistic Regression

📊 Dataset from KaggleHub


The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar
Resting ECG results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise induced angina
Oldpeak (ST depression)
Target (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)




🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Google Colab



🔄 Project Workflow
Data loading using Kaggle Hub dataset and understanding
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation
Prediction




📈 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:
Accuracy score

The Logistic Regression model provides a reliable prediction of heart disease based on the given medical parameters and serves as a strong baseline model for binary classification problems.



🔮 Future Improvements
Will try other algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
Perform hyperparameter tuning
Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
Add more evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC)
